            <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 sesame-seed hamburger bun</li>
                <li>1/4 lb. ground beef</li>
                <li>1/16 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>3 dill pickle slices</li>
                <li>3-4 sliced onion rings</li>
                <li>2 tomato slices</li>
                <li>1/4 cup chopped iceberg lettuce</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons mayonnaise (Whopper sauce)</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons ketchup</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Directions:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Season the Ground Beef: Start by seasoning your ground beef. Use 1/2 teaspoon of salt and some black pepper to enhance the flavor of the meat. The salt helps to bring out the natural flavors of the beef, while the pepper adds a bit of heat and complexity.</li>
                <li>Form Patties: After seasoning, form the beef into thin flat patties. </li>
                <li>Butter and Toast Buns: Next, prepare your hamburger buns. Butter the cut sides of the buns lightly. This buttering adds flavor and helps achieve a golden, crispy texture when toasted. Toast both halves of the bun in a skillet over medium heat until they are lightly browned. The toasting adds crunch and prevents the buns from becoming soggy once the burger is assembled. Set these aside once done.</li>
                <li>Preheat Grill: Heat your grill to medium-high. This temperature is optimal for cooking burgers as it sears the outside quickly, locking in juices while ensuring the inside is cooked to a safe temperature.</li>
                <li>Cook the Patties: Place the burger patties on the grill and cook them for 2 to 3 minutes per side. The exact time may vary depending on the thickness of your patties and the desired level of doneness. While cooking, sprinkle a dash of salt on the burgers. This additional salt during cooking helps to bring out the flavors further.</li>
                <li>Assemble the burgers: Build your burger by placing the cooked meat on the bottom bun. Layer 3 to 4 dill pickle slices, 3 to 4 onion slices, and 2 to 3 tomato slices on the meat. These ingredients add a mix of tangy, sharp, and sweet flavors and a variety of textures. Squirt a small amount of ketchup over these, adding a classic, sweet, and tangy burger taste. Add some lettuce for a crisp, fresh element. Finally, spread mayonnaise on the inside of the top bun; mayonnaise adds a creamy texture and balances the other flavors. Place the top bun on your burger.
